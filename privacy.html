                    Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide personal data voluntarily. For example, we will

                <h4>
                    Data that may be collected automatically
                </h4>
                <p>When you use our Services, we may also collect data automatically from you and/or your device which
                    may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data and analytics about your use of our Services;</li>
                    <li>Your IP address and mobile device identifiers (such as your device ID, advertising ID, MAC
                        address, IMEI);</li>
                    <li>Data about your device, such as device name and operating system, browser type and language;
                    </li>
                    <li>Data we collect with cookies and similar technologies;</li>
                    <li>Broad geographic location based on your IP address;</li>
                    <li>Precise geo-location data (GPS, with your consent); and</li>
                    <li>Data about your use of our Services, such as in application interaction and usage metrics.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Advertising ID means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and Google Advertising
                    Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers use for interest
                    based advertising. They are consistent across all apps and thus allow cross-app tracking. On Apple
                    you can opt-out this by choosing “limit ad tracking” option from privacy settings. On Google Android
                    you can opt-out by choosing “Opt-out of interest based ads”.</p>
                <p>Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your
                    device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies
                    (including marketers and advertisers) to recognise your device when you use websites and
                    applications.</p>
                <p>Data about your device refers to data about your device type, device model, device maker, device
                    operating system and its language or other technical data like screen size or processor, or
                    combination of this data available from a device for a developer for checking the device
                    compatibility with a particular application.</p>
                <p>Some of this data may be collected using cookies and/or similar technologies (such as "SDKs" or
                    software development kits), as explained further below.</p>

                    Data that we may obtain from third party sources
                </h4>
                <p>We may receive personal data about you from third party sources. For example, if you clicked on an
                    advertisement to direct you to one of our Services we may be provided with data from which
                    ad-network and advertising campaign the install originated from.</p>

                    from your social media will depend on your social media privacy settings, but it would typically
                    include your basic public profile data such as:</p>

                    <li>profile picture;</li>
                    <li>age range; and</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The data that we may collect from our partners could include;</p>

                    <li>Data to fight fraud (such as click fraud in advertising);</li>
                    <li>Data from platforms that our Services run on (such as to verify payment); and</li>
